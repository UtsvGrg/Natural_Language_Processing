# Natural_Language_Processing

Assignment 2 & 3
Developed Named Entity Recognition (NER), text similarity and machine translation (MT) systems under my college course.
Implemented recurrent neural networks (RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs), transformer models from scratch and fine tuned pretrained
architecture (BERT, GPT, T5) to get highest (F1, Pearson Correlation, BLEU, BERTScore) accuracy among all assignements.

Assignment 4 & Project
Performed Textual Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction in conversations for a SemEval task, utilizing BERT and LSTM to accurately
recognize emotions and understand context and dependencies between previous tokens. Implemented BertForTokenClas-
sification to identify textual spans causing emotion shifts, employing six different models for various emotions using Named
Entity Recognition (NER) techniques with BertForTokenClassification.
